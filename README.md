### Task 1: Term Deposit Subscription Prediction (Bank Marketing)

*Objective:*  

I aimed to predict whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit as a result of a marketing campaign using the Bank Marketing dataset.

*My Approach:*  

I started by loading and exploring the dataset to understand its structure.  
I encoded all categorical variables properly to make them usable for machine learning models.  
Next, I trained classification models such as **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**.  
To evaluate performance, I used **Confusion Matrix, F1-Score, and ROC Curve**.  
Finally, I applied and **LIME** to interpret the predictions and explain at least five cases.

*Results and Findings:*  

I achieved meaningful predictions about customer subscription behavior.  
The evaluation metrics (F1-Score and ROC Curve) showed that Random Forest performed better than Logistic Regression.  
Through LIME explanations, I gained insights into the key features influencing customer decisions.  
These findings can help banks design more effective marketing strategies by focusing on customer attributes that strongly impact deposit subscriptions.

### Task 2: Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning

*Objective:*  

I aimed to cluster customers based on their spending habits and propose marketing strategies tailored to each customer segment using the Mall Customers dataset.

*My Approach:*  

I started with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.  
Then, I applied **K-Means Clustering** to group customers into meaningful clusters.  
To visualize these clusters, I used **PCA** for dimensionality reduction.  
Finally, I suggested marketing strategies relevant to each identified customer segment.

*Results and Findings:*  

I successfully segmented the customers into distinct groups with different spending and income behaviors.  
The PCA visualizations clearly showed the separation between the clusters.  
From these insights, I proposed strategies that can help businesses target each group more effectively, improving customer engagement and marketing efficiency.

### Task 4: Loan Default Risk with Business Cost Optimization

*Objective:*  

I aimed to predict the likelihood of a loan default and optimize the decision threshold based on cost-benefit analysis using the Home Credit Default Risk dataset.  

*My Approach:*  

I cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to prepare it for modeling.  
Then, I trained binary classification models such as **Logistic Regression** and **CatBoost**.  
I defined business cost values for false positives and false negatives.  
Finally, I adjusted the model **threshold** to minimize the overall business cost.  

*Results and Findings:*  

I observed that CatBoost provided stronger predictive performance compared to Logistic Regression.  
By tuning the decision threshold, I was able to achieve a better balance between false positives and false negatives.  
This cost-sensitive approach ensured that the business could minimize financial risk while making smarter loan approval decisions.  
Through this project, I improved my skills in binary classification modeling, cost-based evaluation, and risk modeling.
